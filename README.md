# Milestone-Project-1

Project Description
I plan on making a basic version of chess. It will be pvp.

Game Logic

The player should be able to move any of their pieces on a virtual chess board according to the rules of chess.
Players should be able to take opposing pieces based on the rules of chess.  
White should move first and then turns will alternate.
Have a submit button or similar concept to end each player's turn.
Game over when a king is in checkmate

Deliverables

MVP Criteria
The game must present a playable version of chess.

Post-MVP Plans
I'd like to have some way to track turns and not just have both sides able to move at the same time.
Maybe have an animation of the board turning between turns.

Stretch: Quality of life improvements. Such as restrictin where a piece can be moved etc.

Something I don't know how to do yet: animations maybe? Turn timers?
