# Milestone-Project-1

Project Description
(Replace this text with a brief description of your game and what inspired you to make it.)

Game Logic
Replace this text with pseudocode.
The pseudocode should describe in plain, simple language the logic of the game.
Describe the logic involved in player decisions. 
  - What are the choices available to the player? 
  - What happens when the player makes a choice?
Describe the logic that evaluates the player's victory/loss/progress status.
Deliverables
Even if you have a great big idea for a game, it's important to scope this project according to what you can get done in the next two weeks. We'll refer to your project completion goal using the term Minimum Viable Product (MVP) -- a list of the criteria needed to "ship" a playable version of your game that meets the project requirements.

Don't lose sight of your big ideas, though! Keep a list of further improvements you can refer to as Post-MVP Ideas. You might finish some before our project time is done, or you might work on them later!

For your README, delete this blockquote and fill in the lists below.

MVP Criteria
One thing my game must do to meet my minimum standard.
Another thing.
Etc.
Post-MVP Plans
One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.
Another that will be a stretch.
Something else I don't technically know how to do... yet. :)
